Changes in version 0.6.123 2015-07-28
     + rxnNorm gains a legend argument to control the position of the legend.  This allows the data to be more prominent, since no space is wasted with a separate legend.

Changes in version 0.6.96 2015-07-21
     + Improved formatting of the aov table in rxnNorm using a new function, prettyAOVtable, and other tables were made to appear similarly.
     + All functions updated with if(!requireNamespace)... statements to coordinate with Suggests field.

Changes in version 0.6.56 2015-07-20
     + Brought into compliance with new CRAN namespace policies.
     + Overhauled rxnNorm as gridExtra had significant changes.

Changes in version 0.6.8 2015-05-06
     + Clean up a lot of small inconsistencies.
     + Overhauled compareCats, esp. the coloring of points.
     + Some changes to theme details.
     + The poster argument of compareCats and rxnNorm was replaced with a theme argument for greater flexibility.
     + lmEqn now has a theme argument too.
     + Updated package title.
     + Made some repairs to examplePage.  Now seems to work correctly.

Changes in version 0.6.7 2015-04-20
     + Added functions lpi and lpr.
     + Moved many Imports to Suggests.

Changes in version 0.6.6 2015-04-19
     + Spectroscopy related functions moved to package SpecHelpers
     + Package converted to roxygen2 documentation flow.
     + NEWS file format changed.
     + Many new functions added.  You'll just have to look for yourself.
     + compareCats seems to have a bug.  I'll fix it later.
     + Functions that had an "L" at the end of their name have lost it.
     + New style CITATION.

Changes in version 0.6-5 2014-01-14
     + Small document fixes.
     + Improvements to plotNMRspec.
     + Set exclude = NULL in examplePage.
     + I see a problem with colors of data points in compareCatsL.

Changes in version 0.6-4 2014-07-27
     + Significant repairs to screenThemeL and posterThemeL.
     + Fixed mis-information in rxnNormL.Rd

Changes in version 0.6-3 2013-06-10
     + Fixed a problem with column names in compareCatL.

Changes in version 0.6-2 2013-05-1
     + Fixed a problem with rounding in the plotNMRspec-related functions.

Changes in version 0.6-1 2013-04-13
     + Function compareCatsL which is the lattice equivalent of compareCats was added.
     + Function rxnNormL which is the lattice equivalent of rxnNorm was added.
     + Functions rxnNorm and compareCats which use ggplot2 were put on leave, awaiting repairs  so they work with the new ggplot2.
     + The following function arguments were changed to use a formula interface: compareCatsL, rxnNormL, lmEqn, lmEqnL.
     + Added function examplePage, slightly modified from the version by Sasha Epskamp at sachaepskamp.com/blog/HTMLexamples
     + Added functions posterThemeL and screenThemeL which control the appearance of the graphics output.  Currently these have the SAME settings.
     + Updates to documentation and github site.

Changes in version 0.5-6 2012-07-12
     + All functions have been restored and modified to work with the new ggplot2.  At least I think all is well! (tested with ggplot2_0.9.1)

Changes in version 0.5-5 2011-12-24
     + Numerous changes for 2.14 and with the current ggplot2!
     + Due to changes in ggplot2, ggExtra has been deprecated.  As a result the  table features in rxnNorm have been disabled until the functionality returns.  Sorry.  As a further result, gridExtra and ggExtra have been removed from NAMESPACE and DESCRIPTION.

Changes in version 0.5-4 2011-12-14
     + Modified plotNMRspec and makeSpec so that spectra are drawn consistently regardless of the x.range settings.  Now a consistent number of data points is used and peak height/area/appearance should not change when x.range is changed.

Changes in version 0.5-3 2011-10-31
     + Modified theme_poster and undo_theme_poster to give finer and more deliberate control over plotting parameters.  Should be much clearer if you have to hack the code.
     + Created a NAMESPACE and made other changes for compatibility with R 2.14.

Changes in version 0.5-2 2011-08-01
     + OK, this time I really added the ability to draw an ANOVA summary table to rxnNorm!

Changes in version 0.5-1 2011-7-29
     + Added the ability to draw an ANOVA summary table to rxnNorm.

Changes in version 0.5 2011-7-26
     + Modified gatherSpecFiles and gatherCsv so that a data frame is returned (This was claimed in the help file but not true).  So the data frame is written out as All Specs.csv and saved in the workspace.  Also, the LoggerPro export format .csv is now supported.
     + Added theme_poster for use with ggplot2 objects/figures.  Changes several defaults to be more suited for scientific poster preparation.

Changes in version 0.4 2011-06-05
     + Added functions to process LoggerPro files into something more usable.  These are gatherSpecFiles, gatherCsv, avgLambda, txt2csv, cmbl2csv.

Changes in version 0.3 2011-05-23
     + Added compareCats function.
     + Added rxnNorm function
     + Added argument npoints to makeSpec and plotNMRspec.  For simulating NMR spectra, one has to use more data points to compute the Lorentzian curve as NMR peaks are so narrow.  With npoints = 1000, peaks are often distorted because too few points define them.  npoints = 2000 does a better job (and is slower) but still leaves some slight imbalances in triplets for example, which looks realistic.
     + Added argument labels = FALSE to plotNMRspec which should be useful for 13C NMR spectra.
     + Improved integral label positioning in plotNMRspec to try to avoid overlaps.
     + Added a lab.pos argument for plotNMRspec which allows one to put the labels either left or right of each peak.

Changes in version 0.2 2011-4-19
     + Added the option for noise to makeSpec (suggested by David Harvey).

Changes in version 0.1 2011-3-24
     + First Release!
