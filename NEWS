##### Version: 0.5-5
Date: 2011-12-22
News:
>> Trying to make this work under 2.14 and with the current ggplot2!
>> Due to changes in ggplot2, ggExtra has been deprecated.  As a result the  table features in rxnNorm have been disabled until the functionality returns.  Sorry.  As a further result, gridExtra and ggExtra have been removed from NAMESPACE and DESCRIPTION.

##### Version: 0.5-4
Date: 2011-12-14
News:
>> Modified plotNMRspec and makeSpec so that spectra are drawn consistently regardless of the x.range settings.  Now a consistent number of data points is used and peak height/area/appearance should not change when x.range is changed.

##### Version: 0.5-3
Date: 2011-10-31
News:
>> Modified theme_poster and undo_theme_poster to give finer and more deliberate control over plotting parameters.  Should be much clearer if you have to hack the code.
>> Created a NAMESPACE and made other changes for compatibility with R 2.14.

##### Version: 0.5-2
Date: 2011-08-01
News:
>> OK, this time I really added the ability to draw an ANOVA summary table to rxnNorm!

##### Version: 0.5-1
Date: 2011-7-29
News:
>> Added the ability to draw an ANOVA summary table to rxnNorm.

##### Version: 0.5
Date: 2011-7-26
News:
>> Modified gatherSpecFiles and gatherCsv so that a data frame is returned (This was claimed in the help file but not true).  So the data frame is written out as All Specs.csv and saved in the workspace.  Also, the LoggerPro export format .csv is now supported.
>> Added theme_poster for use with ggplot2 objects/figures.  Changes several defaults to be more suited for scientific poster preparation.

##### Version: 0.4
Date: 2011-06-05
News:
>> Added functions to process LoggerPro files into something more usable.  These are gatherSpecFiles, gatherCsv, avgLambda, txt2csv, cmbl2csv.

##### Version: 0.3
Date: 2011-05-23
News:
>> Added compareCats function.
>> Added rxnNorm function
>> Added argument npoints to makeSpec and plotNMRspec.  For simulating NMR spectra, one has to use more data points to compute the Lorentzian curve as NMR peaks are so narrow.  With npoints = 1000, peaks are often distorted because too few points define them.  npoints = 2000 does a better job (and is slower) but still leaves some slight imbalances in triplets for example, which looks realistic.
>> Added argument labels = FALSE to plotNMRspec which should be useful for 13C NMR spectra.
>> Improved integral label positioning in plotNMRspec to try to avoid overlaps.
>> Added a lab.pos argument for plotNMRspec which allows one to put the labels either left or right of each peak.

##### Version: 0.2
Date: 2011-4-19
News:
>> Added the option for noise to makeSpec (suggested by David Harvey).

##### Version: 0.1
Date: 2011-3-24
News: First Release!
