How to install HandyStuff
===================

To install from Github using R:
------------------------------

install.packages("ggExtra", repos="http://R-Forge.R-project.org") # needed for HandyStuff

install.packages("devtools")

library("devtools")

install_github(repo = "HandyStuff", username = "bryanhanson", branch = "master")

library("HandyStuff")

?HandyStuff # the help files

If you use branch = "devel" you can get the development branch if it is available.  My habit is to keep these operational but not necessarily complete.
