Note: this version (0.5-5) does not run it's examples correctly with either ggplot2 0.8.9 or 0.9.0, the latter from Github branch master.  Work in progress!

The files here do build and check OK provided R --vanilla CMD check --no-examples is used, so you can install from here (but you'll run into errors if you use any functions relying on ggplot2).

How to install HandyStuff
===================

To install from Github using R:
------------------------------

install.packages("ggExtra", repos="http://R-Forge.R-project.org") # needed for HandyStuff

install.packages("devtools")

library("devtools")

install_github(repo = "HandyStuff", username = "bryanhanson", branch = "master")

library("HandyStuff")

?HandyStuff # the help files

If you use branch = "devel" you can get the development branch if it is available.  My habit is to keep these operational but not necessarily complete.
